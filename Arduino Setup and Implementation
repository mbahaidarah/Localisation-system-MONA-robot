# Arduino Setup and Implementation
Since the MONA robots can be programmed using Arduino software, we need to prepare all the libraries that allow us to program it and use the Wi-Fi module for communication.


## Arduino Setup:
1. Install Arduino in your PC.
2. Go to this github page: https://github.com/yorkrobotlab/swarmhack/tree/master/mona/lib/MONA_ESP_lib
